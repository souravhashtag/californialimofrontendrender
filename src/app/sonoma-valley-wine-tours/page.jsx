                    Sonoma Wine Country is the birthplace of California’s wine industry.
                    Visit Sonoma’s oldest commercial winery, Buena Vista and the oldest,
                    continuously operating family winery, Gundlach-Bundschu. TripAdvisor
                    named Sonoma as the best wine destination in the United States. Let us
                    take you on a Sonoma Wine Tour by limousine, limo-bus, SUV or luxury
                    sedan. We know Sonoma.

                    In addition to being the home of some very famous name-brand wineries,
                    the elaborate construction and immaculate rows of grapes combined with
                    beautiful landscapes make visiting Sonoma as much of a sightseeing
                    trip as a wine tasting trip. As an example, Jordan Winery’s
                    ivy-covered chateau in Alexander Valley is a very impressive sight as
                    it is modeled after the chateaus of France and surrounded by culinary
                    gardens and vines. When visiting Jordan, there are five unique wine
                    tastings offered, all of which include food pairings, enhanced by the
                    winery’s expansive views.

                    When selecting a limo company, the staff should be knowledgeable and
                    experienced about all aspects of wine tasting. This includes knowing
                    where the historic caves are, which wineries are good for small groups
                    and which ones handle large groups with ease. They should be able to
                    recommend an awesome bed and breakfast spot as well as local hotels.
                    They should be able to recommend the best dining spots including the
                    best wineries to have a picnic or the best restaurant located near
                    your favorite winery.

                    Most importantly, they should know wine. California Limo Wine Tours
                    can pair your wine tastes with the right winery because of our vast
                    knowledge and relationships with the area wineries. The planning of

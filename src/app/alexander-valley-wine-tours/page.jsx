                    The Alexander Valley Appellation is a gorgeous, captivating valley in
                    northern Sonoma County. You may travel through grapes produced on the
                    floor and up into the stunning Mayacama Mountains above you. Visit the
                    wineries to taste sophisticated, exceptional wines from the local
                    farming family. An area that produces wines with a distinct sense of
                    location built on history and rich in farming culture. You will get a
                    better grasp of our wines and our way of life. This section of Sonoma
                    is warmer than other regions due to protection from Pacific breezes
                    from the nearby hillside, but it gets a little cooler at night. The
                    day's warmth is sufficient to cause the grapes to mature, producing
                    rich, fleshy wines. The rainy season is longer since it is heavier in
                    the winter and spring. Join us as we tour Alexander Valley, California
                    soak up the warm hospitality of its people, and savor its distinctive
                    wines—a wine that tells a story of this enchanted location.
